# Coffee-Machine
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy. In this project, a coffee machine simulator is programmed. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. We can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
